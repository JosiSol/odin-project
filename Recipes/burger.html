    <h2>Simple Burger</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">The simple burger is a timeless classic that has become a staple in many households and restaurants around the world. Known for its straightforward preparation and delicious taste, the simple burger consists of a juicy beef patty, seasoned with just salt and pepper, and cooked to perfection. It is typically served on a toasted bun with traditional toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and a slice of cheese. The simplicity of the ingredients allows the natural flavors of the beef to shine, making it a favorite for those who appreciate a no-fuss, satisfying meal.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Creating the perfect simple burger starts with selecting high-quality ground beef, preferably with a good fat content to ensure juiciness and flavor. The beef is then formed into patties, taking care not to overwork the meat to maintain its tenderness. Cooking the patties on a hot grill or skillet helps to achieve a nice sear on the outside while keeping the inside moist and flavorful. The simple burger's versatility allows for endless customization, whether you prefer to add a special sauce, bacon, or avocado. Despite its name, the simple burger offers a delightful and fulfilling dining experience that can be enjoyed by everyone.</p>

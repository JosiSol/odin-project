    <h2>Kitfo</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Kitfo is a traditional Ethiopian dish that is highly regarded for its rich flavors and cultural significance. It is made from finely minced raw beef, which is seasoned with a blend of spices, including mitmita (a spicy chili powder) and niter kibbeh (a clarified butter infused with herbs and spices). Kitfo is often served with a side of injera, a spongy flatbread made from teff flour, and a variety of accompaniments such as gomen (collard greens) and ayib (Ethiopian cottage cheese). This dish is a staple in Ethiopian cuisine and is particularly popular during special occasions and celebrations.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The preparation of kitfo requires careful attention to detail to ensure the meat is fresh and properly seasoned. Traditionally, kitfo is served raw, but it can also be lightly cooked upon request, known as "leb leb." The dish's unique combination of flavors and textures makes it a favorite among those who appreciate bold and spicy foods. Kitfo's cultural importance extends beyond its taste, as it is often associated with hospitality and communal dining, reflecting the Ethiopian values of sharing and togetherness. Whether enjoyed in a traditional setting or as part of a modern meal, kitfo offers a delicious and authentic taste of Ethiopian culinary heritage.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 pounds lean beef, such as boneless knuckle or top round
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 cup kibbeh (seasoned clarified butter) or ghee
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons mitmita (Ethiopian spiced chile blend) and 1/2 teaspoon ground korerima (black cardamom)
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 teaspoon koseret powder (earthy, woodsy dried Ethiopian herb) and 1/4 teaspoon fine salt
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cut the beef into thin slices, trim any fat and then mince into very small cubes, preferably by hand, or in a food processor. Set the beef aside, spreading it over a plate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt the kibbeh in a medium skillet over very low heat. Add the mitmita, korerima, koseret and salt and stir with the butter. Then, add the minced beef and mash to mix it with the spiced butter; keep mixing until the beef reaches your desired temperature, 3 to 5 minutes for rare. Serve with farmer's or cottage cheese, Gomen Kitfo and injera.
